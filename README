Dream5igns is a photo portfolio website built on the Flickr API.  I tag my
best photos with a Flickr tag, and then dynamically build a gallery to
showcase just those photos.

First things first: Open up flickr/flickr_settings.py.example, edit it with
your API key and username (or the username of the photostream you're
interested in).

Then run it as you would any Django site.
